# Description of Classes:
The ClothingMarketPlace Java class is a simplified representation of a clothing marketplace application. It manages users, products, customers, and sellers, using JSON files to save and load the marketplace state. The program starts by loading the marketplace data or creating a new one if no data exists. It then guides users (customers or sellers) through their actions in the marketplace, repeating this process until the user decides to exit. The class includes methods for adding users, getting marketplace items, and obtaining a list of all stores. It also keeps track of product and store counts to ensure uniqueness. The loadMarketPlace method loads the marketplace from a file, and saveMarketPlace saves the current state back to the file. Overall, this class handles user authentication, actions, and marketplace management with a focus on simplicity. It has a relationship to all classes as it is the unifying class of all classes and it is the framework for the actual application itself. We tested utilizing all options on the menu and attempting to break the program by diagnosing individual possibilities.

# Customer Class:
The Customer class in the Clothing Marketplace project represents the behavior and actions that customers can perform in the system. Customers can add items to their shopping cart, search and filter products, view stores, manage their cart, check out, view purchase history, and perform other related actions. The class extends the User class and is closely connected to the ShoppingItem, MarketPlace, and Statistics classes. Customers interact with the marketplace through a series of user-friendly prompts, and the class includes methods for handling cart operations, searching products, changing passwords, and exporting purchase history. In order to test, we added and removed items from the cart, searched and filtered products, and checked out. The Customer class collaborates with other components of the system, contributing to the overall functionality and user experience of the Clothing Marketplace application.

# MarketPlace Class:
The MarketPlace class in the Clothing Marketplace project serves as a central repository for managing and displaying shopping items. It facilitates listing stores and products, allows users to view details about a specific product, and provides sorting methods for organizing items alphabetically and by price. The class collaborates with the ShoppingItem class, managing an ArrayList of products, and contributes to the overall functionality of the Clothing Marketplace application. Testing involves ensuring correct sorting and accurate product details display. 

# Product Class:
The Product class in the Clothing Marketplace project represents individual products with attributes such as name, description, quantity, price, and a unique ID. It supports various constructors, including one for creating products from a CSV string. The class incorporates getter and setter methods for each attribute, ensuring proper data handling. Testing involves verifying that quantity and price are set correctly and that the removeQuantity method functions as expected. The class also overrides the equals method to compare products based on their IDs. The toString method provides a formatted representation of the product. Additionally, the class includes an action method for modifying product details interactively through user input. This class collaborates with other components of the project, such as the ShoppingItem and MarketPlace classes, contributing to the overall functionality of the Clothing Marketplace application.

# Seller Class:
The Seller class in the Clothing Marketplace project represents sellers, each associated with one or more stores. It extends the User class and includes functionality for creating, opening, and managing stores, importing/exporting product data, changing passwords, and viewing statistics. During testing, the class demonstrated the ability to add stores, handle store creation and login processes, and interact with product data. The methods for importing and exporting product data were verified by reading from and writing to files successfully. The class maintains a relationship with the Store, Product, and ClothingMarketPlace classes, utilizing them to perform actions such as managing stores, accessing product information, and interacting with the overall marketplace functionality. Additionally, the Seller class integrates the Statistics class to display seller-specific statistics, contributing to the comprehensive functionality of the Clothing Marketplace application.

# ShoppingItem Class:
The ShoppingItem class in the Clothing Marketplace project represents individual shopping items, each associated with a specific product, seller, and store. The class features constructors for creating shopping items with various parameters, including product details and seller/store information. It contains getters and setters to access and modify these attributes, enabling flexibility in constructing and updating shopping items. During testing, the class demonstrated its ability to create shopping items with different sets of parameters and implemented reliable equals and toString methods. The equals method ensures an accurate comparison of shopping items based on their associated product IDs. The toString method provides a formatted string representation of the shopping item for clear output. The ShoppingItem class is closely related to the Product class, utilizing its instance for storing product details, and it plays a crucial role in connecting the buyer's shopping cart to the marketplace's overall structure. Its attributes and methods contribute to the comprehensive functionality of the Clothing Marketplace application by facilitating the representation and manipulation of individual shopping items within the larger system.

# Statistics Class:
The Statistics class in the Clothing Marketplace project is responsible for processing and analyzing shopping data, and generating statistical reports for both customers and sellers. It maintains an ArrayList of ShoppingItem objects, each representing a purchase transaction. The class offers methods to add shopping items, read data from a file, and display statistics for customers and sellers. The displayCustomerStatistics method calculates and outputs the number of products sold by store and the products purchased by each customer. Similarly, the displaySellerStatistics method calculates and outputs the items purchased by each customer and the sales for each product. During testing, the class demonstrated its functionality by accurately processing data, generating meaningful statistics, and writing the results to specified output files. Its relationship with the ShoppingItem class is evident as it relies on shopping item data to derive meaningful insights into customer and seller activities within the marketplace. The Statistics class plays a crucial role in providing valuable analytics for the Clothing Marketplace application, aiding both customers and sellers in understanding purchasing patterns and sales performance.

# Store Class:
The Store class in the Clothing Marketplace project models individual stores within the marketplace and encompasses the actions that can be performed on them. It maintains an ArrayList of Product objects, representing the inventory of the store. The class provides constructors to create a store with or without products, and it allows for the addition, retrieval, modification, and deletion of products within the store. The actions method enables sellers to perform various operations on their store, such as creating, modifying, and deleting products, as well as sorting the store's inventory by name or price. During testing, the class demonstrated its functionality by effectively managing store inventories and responding to user inputs accurately. Its relationship with the Product class is evident as it interacts with product data, and it collaborates with the MarketPlace class for sorting operations. The Store class plays a pivotal role in facilitating the management of individual seller stores within the Clothing Marketplace application.

# User Class:
The User class in the Clothing Marketplace project serves as the base class for both customers and sellers. It encapsulates the common attributes and methods related to user accounts, including email and password management. The class provides getters and setters for email and password, as well as methods for user authentication such as login and signup. The equals method ensures that user comparisons are case-insensitive. The class includes a static logIn method to authenticate users by checking their email and password against a provided list of users. Similarly, the signUp method allows users to create new accounts, and it distinguishes between customers and sellers. The authentication method presents a menu for users to either log in, sign up, or exit the authentication process. The class has been tested to ensure accurate user authentication and account creation, and it interacts closely with the Customer and Seller classes, which extend the User class, enabling differentiation between the two user types in the marketplace application.
